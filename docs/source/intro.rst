nDTomo software suite
=====================
The nDTomo software suite contains a graphical user interface (GUI) and python scripts for the simulation, visualisation, preprocessing and analysis of X-ray chemical imaging and tomography data.

Documentation for the GUI will be provided at (under construction): https://ndtomo.readthedocs.io

The aim of this library is to generate tools for the following:

1. **Generation of multi-modal and multi-dimensional phantoms**

2. **Simulation of various computed tomography data acquisition strategies**

3. **Creation of demonstration scripts** for:
   - (a) Integration of XRD-CT data
   - (b) Processing and correcting sinograms and radiographs for X-ray computed tomography data for various artefacts

4. **Application of computed tomography reconstruction algorithms** from basic principles to practical applications

5. **Dimensionality reduction of chemical imaging data and data analysis through multi-peak fitting**
