nDTomo software suite
=====================

The nDTomo software suite contains python scripts for the simulation, visualisation, preprocessing and analysis of X-ray chemical imaging and tomography data as well as a graphical user interface (GUI) for analysis of chemical imaging data.

The aim of this library is to generate tools for the following:

1. **Generation of multi-dimensional phantoms**

2. **Simulation of various pencil beam computed tomography data acquisition strategies**

3. **Processing and correcting sinogram data**

4. **Application of computed tomography reconstruction algorithms**

5. **Data analysis of chemical imaging data through peak fitting**
