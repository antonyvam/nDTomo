nDTomo software suite
=====================
The nDTomo software suite contains a graphical user interface (GUI) and python scripts for the simulation, visualisation, pre-processing and analysis of X-ray chemical imaging and tomography data.

Documentation for the GUI will be provided at (under construction): https://ndtomo.readthedocs.io

The aim of this library is to generate tools for the following:
1. **Generation of multi-modal and multi-dimensional phantoms**
2. **Simulation of various computed tomography data acquisition strategies**
3. **Creation of demonstration scripts** for:
   - Integration of XRD-CT data
   - Processing and correcting sinograms and radiographs for X-ray computed tomography data for various artefacts
4. **Application of computed tomography reconstruction algorithms** from basic principles to practical applications
5. **Dimensionality reduction of chemical imaging data and data analysis through multi-peak fitting**

Installation instructions from sources
--------------------------------------
An important part of the code is based on astra-toolbox (and tomopy) which is currently available through conda so to make your life easier please install anaconda. It is possible to install astra-toolbox/tomopy from sources (i.e. if one wants to avoid using conda) but it is not a trivial task. I suggest you create a new anaconda environment for nDTomo (e.g. using the anaconda navigator) and make sure to install first the IDEs (Jupyter lab, Spyder etc) before installing the nDTomo.

To install from git:

```pip install git+https://github.com/antonyvam/nDTomo.git```

For development work:

```
git clone https://github.com/antonyvam/nDTomo.git && cd nDTomo
pip install -e .
```

For local installation, using the flag --user:

```
pip install --user -e .
```

or:

```
python3 setup.py install --user
```

For example, as a user at the Diamond Light Source:

```
git clone https://github.com/antonyvam/nDTomo.git && cd nDTomo
module load python/3
python setup.py install --user
```

Installation instructions using conda (Windows only)
----------------------------------------------------
The conda package of nDTomo might not be up to date so try installing from sources. The nDTomo is currently being developed using python v3.8

I suggest you create a new anaconda environment for nDTomo (e.g. using the anaconda navigator) and then simply run the following:

Make sure that you have added the following channels:

```conda config --add channels conda-forge```

```conda config --add channels astra-toolbox/label/dev```

Next install nDTomo:

```conda install -c antonyvam ndtomo```

Tensorflow is not included in the conda package so one has to install it using pip (please see below for more information).
