        "# Image Reconstruction from Sinograms\n",
        "## **A Tutorial on CT Reconstruction in NumPy and PyTorch**\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Overview**\n",
        "This tutorial explores how tomographic image reconstruction can be implemented using direct matrix methods and custom-coded forward/backprojection routines. The goal is to demystify CT reconstruction by showing how core techniques like **backprojection**, **filtered backprojection (FBP)**, and **iterative algorithms** such as **SIRT** and **CGLS** can be implemented from first principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "We demonstrate that reconstructions can be achieved using two main approaches:\n",
        "- A **matrix-based method**, where the forward model is explicitly represented as a system matrix **A**.\n",
        "- A **functional method**, where forward and backprojectors are implemented using `scipy.ndimage.rotate` in for-loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both approaches yield similar reconstruction results, and we will show their equivalence visually.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, this tutorial also introduces **GPU acceleration using PyTorch**, showcasing how much faster reconstructions become when using the same forward/backprojector logic with CUDA support. This is particularly useful when scaling to larger image sizes or for training machine learning models on synthetic reconstructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Objectives**\n",
        "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
        "- Understand how to represent the CT forward model as a matrix **A** and use it for direct and iterative reconstruction.\n",
        "- Implement custom forward and backprojectors using simple NumPy and `rotate`-based loops.\n",
        "- Compare reconstruction quality and runtime across methods.\n",
        "- Accelerate the same reconstruction logic using PyTorch with GPU support.\n",
        "- Gain insight into why matrix methods don’t scale well and when loop-based approaches become preferable.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Reconstruction Methods Covered**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Backprojection (BP)**\n",
        "The simplest form of reconstruction, implemented by smearing each projection back along its acquisition angle. It yields a blurred image but forms the basis for FBP and iterative methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Filtered Backprojection (FBP)**\n",
        "A fast analytic method that applies a ramp filter in the frequency domain before backprojection. This produces high-quality results for noise-free or well-conditioned sinograms.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Iterative Methods: SIRT and CGLS**\n",
        "These methods solve the inverse problem iteratively by minimizing the error between measured and simulated projections:\n",
        "- **SIRT** (Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique) is simple and stable.\n",
        "- **CGLS** (Conjugate Gradient for Least Squares) converges quickly and handles large systems efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Matrix-Based Forward Model**\n",
        "The forward operator is represented explicitly as a sparse matrix **A**, allowing for direct inversion or use in iterative solvers via `A.T @ (A @ x - b)`. This method is mathematically transparent but limited in scalability due to memory constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. Custom Loop-Based Forward/Backward Operators**\n",
        "Here, forward projection is performed using rotation-based integration across the object. This mimics the behavior of a real scanner and allows reconstruction on large-scale images without forming **A** explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **6. PyTorch GPU Acceleration**\n",
        "All of the above methods can be ported to PyTorch and run on GPU. This dramatically speeds up reconstruction, particularly for iterative methods or large sinogram stacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Why This Matters**\n",
        "- Reconstruction is the core of computed tomography, and understanding how it works under the hood enables better debugging, algorithm development, and performance optimization.\n",
        "- Many advanced ML-based approaches (e.g., learned iterative reconstructions) build on these foundations.\n",
        "- This notebook provides a minimal, educational implementation of these techniques that can be scaled, extended, or incorporated into your own imaging workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s now walk through each reconstruction approach step by step — from matrix formulation to GPU acceleration — and evaluate their accuracy and performance."

        "\n",
        "Before performing backprojection, it's essential to filter the sinogram to correct for the inherent blurring introduced by the projection process. This is a key step in Filtered Backprojection (FBP) and is based on the physics of how the Radon transform behaves in frequency space.\n",

        "   - **Ramp filter (Ram-Lak)**: Enhances high-frequency components to correct for blurring.\n",
        "   - **Shepp-Logan filter**: A smoother version of the ramp, which reduces noise amplification by multiplying with a sinc function.\n",
